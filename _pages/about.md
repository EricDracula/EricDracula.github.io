I'm now a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in <a href="http://www.insc.tsinghua.edu.cn">Institute for Network Science and Cyberspace</a> of <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn">Tsinghua University</a>, advised by <a href="http://routing.netlab.edu.cn/tiki-index.php?page=Mingwei+Xu">Prof. Mingwei Xu</a>. From my last undergraduate year and first graduate year, I worked under the supervision of <a href="http://netarchlab.tsinghua.edu.cn/~junbi/">Prof. Jun Bi</a>, a diligent and kind professor. Unfortunately, he suddenly passed away in Feb., 2019.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
