From my last undergraduate year and first graduate year, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Jun Bi](http://netarchlab.tsinghua.edu.cn/~junbi/){:target="\_blank"}, a diligent and kind professor. Unfortunately, he suddenly passed away in Feb., 2019.

Besides, I have deeply involved in a set of scenarios, such as cloud gateway, Denial-of-Service attacks, Network Intrusion Detection/Prevention System, Internet of Things and etc. Most of my projects are trying to make distributed system more security and reliable.
