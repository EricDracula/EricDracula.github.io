Hi, I'm Guanyu Li, a 2nd-year Ph.D. student in [Institute for Network Science and Cyberspace](http://www.insc.tsinghua.edu.cn){:target="\_blank"} of [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn){:target="\_blank"}, advised by [Prof. Mingwei Xu](http://routing.netlab.edu.cn/tiki-index.php?page=Mingwei+Xu){:target="\_blank"}.
For my last undergraduate year and first graduate year, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Jun Bi](http://netarchlab.tsinghua.edu.cn/~junbi/){:target="\_blank"}, a diligent and kind professor. Unfortunately, he suddenly passed away in Feb., 2019.
Besides, I hold B.Eng. Degree in [School of Computer Science & Technology](http://cs.hust.edu.cn){:target="\_blank"} from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](http://www.hust.edu.cn){:target="\_blank"}.

Research Interests
------
My research works explore how to utilize the programmability of networks and kernels to enhance the security of systems.
Hence, I am familiar with [Software Defined Networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_networking){:target="\_blank"} (**SDN**), [Network Function Virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_function_virtualization){:target="\_blank"} (**NFV**), and [Programmable Data Plane](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/answer/What-is-a-programmable-data-plane-and-where-does-P4-fit-in){:target="\_blank"} (**PDP, P4**).
In addition, I have digged into a set of fields, such as [**Cloud Gateway**](https://www.telco.com/blog/what-is-cloud-gateway/){:target="\_blank"}, [Denial-of-Service attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack){:target="\_blank"} (**DoS**), [Intrusion Detection/Prevention System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system){:target="\_blank"} (**IDS/IPS**) and etc.
